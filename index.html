        <p><em><strong>Ex Professional Footballer / Hotelier</strong> who is learning how to code.</em></p>
        <p>I am ex Professional Footballer who was playing in one of the best football team in Poland, named "ŁKS Łódź".
          After ending the football career, I moved to Edinburgh in Scotland where I started a job in the hotel which gave me plenty of knowledge about people and life.
          I quickly understood, that both career paths were not something, that I would devote my daily life into, so surely learning to code was the right choice.
          It gives me a lot of enjoyment and I can see myself as a Web/App Developer in a future.</p>
